_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Specs

* Business logic that creates a player object, stores a players total and round scores and a unique ID
* Game rules:
  *  If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing for the turn but the player score is not affected
  * If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn score until their turn ends or they roll a 1
  * When their turn ends, their turn score is added to their player score
  * When the player score hits 100, the game ends, the player with 100 wins, and the winner receives a victory point
* User logic that displays all relevant scoring information, the rules of the game, buttons for rolling and ending a turn

## Tests

Describe: PlayerConstructor();
  1. Test: "It creates a constructor object for a player"
  Code:
  function PlayerConstructor {playerId, turnScore, playerScore}
  Expected Output: let playerName = new PlayerConstructor {playerId, turnScore, playerScore}

  Describe: "createPlayer"
  2. Test: "It creates a player using the PlayerConstructor"
  Code:
  let createPlayer = new PlayerConstructor(playerId, turnScore, playerScore)
  Expected Output:
